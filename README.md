### Wtf is this?
Shattered World is an isometric action-RPG with next-gen level graphics!

### Why don't you use game engines to create your useless game in a reasonable time?
Because only noobs use game engines, cool guys write their own wheels all their life!

### Use Photoshop at least, why Paint, oh, my eyes!
No.

### So, when will it be ready?
Soon (c) ~~(probably never)~~
